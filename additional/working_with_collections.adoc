[.lead]
The Astra REST API provides several different ways to access resource collections through the defined query parameters.

==== Selecting values

You can specify which key-value pairs should be returned for each resource instance using the `include` parameter. All of the instances are returned in the response body. See the workflow link:../workflows/wf_list_unman_apps.html[List the unmanaged apps] for an example.

==== Filtering

Collection resource filtering allows an API user to specify conditions which determine if a resource is returned in the response body. The `filter` parameter is used to indicate the filtering condition.

==== Sorting

Collection resource sorting allows an API user to specify the order in which resources are returned in the response body. The `orderBy` parameter is used to indicate the filtering condition.

==== Pagination

You can enforce pagination by restricting the number of resource instances returned on a request using the `limit` parameter.

==== Count

If you include the Boolean parameter `count` set to `true`, the number of resources in the returned array for a given response is provided in the metadata section.
