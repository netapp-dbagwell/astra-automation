You can issue a simple Curl command at your workstation’s CLI to get started using the Astra REST API and confirm its availability.

.Before you begin

The Curl utility must be available on your local workstation. You must also have an API token and the associated account identifier. See link:get_api_token.html[Get an API access token] for more information.

.Curl example

The following Curl command retrieves a list of Astra users. Provide the appropriate <ACCOUNT_ID> and <API_TOKEN> as indicated.

[source,curl]
curl --location --request GET 'https://astra.netapp.io/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/core/v1/users' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>'
