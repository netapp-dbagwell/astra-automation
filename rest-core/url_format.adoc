[.lead]
The general structure of the URL used to access a resource instance or collection through the REST API is composed of several values. This structure reflects the underlying object model and system design.

== Format of the URL

The format of the URL with an example is presented below.

===== Account as the root

The root of the resource path to every REST endpoint is the Astra account. And so all paths in the URL begin with `/account/{account_id}` where `account_id` is the unique UUIDv4 value for the account. Internally structure this reflects a design where all resource access is based on a specific account.

===== Endpoint resource category

The Astra resource endpoints fall into three different categories:

* Core (`/core`)
* Managed application (`/k8s`)
* Topology (`/topology`)

See link:../endpoints/resources.html[Resources] for more information.

===== Category version

Each of the three resource categories has a global version that controls the version of the resources accessed. By convention and definition, moving to a new major version of a resource category (such as, from `/v1` to `/v2`) will introduce breaking changes in the API.

===== Resource instance or collection

A combination of resource types and identifiers can be used in the path, based on whether a resource instance or collection is accessed.

===== Example

* Resource path
+
Based on the structure presented above, a typical path to an endpoint is: `/accounts/{account_id}/core/v1/users`.

* Complete URL
+
The full URL for the corresponding endpoint is: `https://astra.netapp.io/accounts/{account_id}/core/v1/users`.
